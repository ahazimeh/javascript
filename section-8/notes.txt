js is a high-level prototype-based object-oriented multi-paradigm interpreted or just-in-time programming language with first-class functions and non-blocking event loop concurrency model

human readable code to machine code: compiling or interpreting
paradigm: An approach and mindset of structuring code, which will direct your coding style and technique:
popular paradigm:
    procedural programming
    oop
    functional programming(FP)
js does all of the above

object oriented nature of js it is a prototype based object oriented approach, almost everything in js is an object except for premetive values

js is a language with first class fn which means that fns are treated as regular values

dynamic language: we don't assign types to variables

concurrency model: how js engine handles multiple tasks at the same time
js runs in one single thread and therefore we need a way of handling multiple things happening at the same time
event loop takes long running tasks and executes them in the background

js engine is a program that executes a js code
js contains a call stack and a heap,
call stack is where our code is executed using execution context
heap is an unstructured memory pool which stores all the objects that our application needs

compilation vs interpretation
in compilation the entire source code is converted into machine code at once and this machine code is written into a portable file that can be exececuted on any computer

interpretation is where code is read and exececuted line by line
ofcourse the source code needs to be converted to machine coded but it happens write before it is executed and not a head of time

js is used to be an interpreted language but it is much much slower but now with modern js, js engines use a mix between compilation and interpretation(just-in-time compilation)
just-in-time compilation: compiles the entire code into machine code at once and then executes it write away

code will be parsed to ast then compiled to machine code and then it gets executed

first js engine will produce an unoptimized version of the code so it starts fast and keep optimizing the code in the background

js in node js doesn't have web apis but it uses c++ bindings & thread pool
