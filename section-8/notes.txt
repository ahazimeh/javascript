js is a high-level prototype-based object-oriented multi-paradigm interpreted or just-in-time programming language with first-class functions and non-blocking event loop concurrency model

human readable code to machine code: compiling or interpreting
paradigm: An approach and mindset of structuring code, which will direct your coding style and technique:
popular paradigm:
    procedural programming
    oop
    functional programming(FP)
js does all of the above

object oriented nature of js it is a prototype based object oriented approach, almost everything in js is an object except for premetive values

js is a language with first class fn which means that fns are treated as regular values

dynamic language: we don't assign types to variables

concurrency model: how js engine handles multiple tasks at the same time
js runs in one single thread and therefore we need a way of handling multiple things happening at the same time
event loop takes long running tasks and executes them in the background
