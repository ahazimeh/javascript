higher order function:
a fn that receives another fn as an argument, that returns a new function, or both
first class fn:
first class functions means that all functions are values, so it is just a concept

fn.name to get the name of a fn

call and apply methods:
to set the this keyword
book.call(swiss, 583, 'Marry Cooper');// so this will be set to swiss
similarly for apply but it takes an array rather than a lot of args
book.apply(swiss, [583, 'Marry Cooper']);

// Bind is better because it returns a new function that is bind to certain object
const bookEW = book.bind(eurowings);
and we can also set parameters
const bookEW23 = book.bind(eurowings,23) // so when we use bookWE23 the first param will be set automatically to 23
this is called partial application (a part of the arguments of the original function are already applied)

when using callback function the this keyword points to the original function
