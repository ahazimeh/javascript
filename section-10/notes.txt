a fn that receives another fn as an argument, that returns a new function, or both
first class fn:
first class functions means that all functions are values, so it is just a concept

fn.name to get the name of a fn

to set the this keyword
book.call(swiss, 583, 'Marry Cooper');// so this will be set to swiss
similarly for apply but it takes an array rather than a lot of args
book.apply(swiss, [583, 'Marry Cooper']);
