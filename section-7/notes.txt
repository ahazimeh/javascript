DOM: Document Object Model: a structured respresentation of html documents. Allows js to access html elements and styles to manipulate them
dom is a connection point between html documents and js code.
it is created by the browser automatically as soon as the html page loads and it is stored in a tree structure where each html element is 1 object
everything in the html element should be also in the dom

the dom is not a part of js, the dom and dom methods are part of web apis
web apis are like libraries that browsers implement and we can access from our js code
there is actually official dom specification that browsers implement which is the reason why dom manipulation works the same in all browsers
