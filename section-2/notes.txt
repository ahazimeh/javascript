javascript is a high-level object-oriented, multi-paradigm programming language.
multi-paradigm: flexible and versatile, we can use all kinds of different programming styles such as declarative and imparative programming

ES: ECMAScript

name is a reserved word but it is allowed to use, still it could cause some problems

data types: Number, String, Boolean, Undefined, Null, Symbol(es2015-value that is unique and cannot be changed), BigInt(es2020-larger than Number)

in js it is the value that has the type, not the variable

â‹† Asterisk

type of null is an object and this is a bug in js but never corrected for legacy reasons
const for immutable variables

basic operators:
2**3 is 2 to the power 3
+-=*/ x+=

operator precedence
google mdn operator precedence (mdn for mosilla developer network)
mdn is a well known and widely used documentation site

to write on multiple lines(it works because of a bug in the language):
'hsdjfhsd \n\
dshfuisdhf'

if else statement is called if else control structure
because this structure actually allows us to have more control over the way our code is executed

type conversion and coercion
type conversion is when we manually convert from one type to another
type coercion is when js automatically converts types behind the scenes for us
type conversion:
Number('1991'), String(12)
typeof NaN is a number
js can convert to a number, to a string, and to a boolean
type coercion:
like concatinating string with a number
for + numbers are converted to strings and for -, *, ** and / the opposite happens

5 falsy values: 0, '', undefined, null, NaN (false is ofcourse false)
ex: Boolean(0) will be false

=== is strict equality operator
== is the loose equality operator(this does equality type coercion)

if else is a statement
x = 5; 5 is an expression because it produces a values, 5*2 is an expression
expressions produces values and statements are like full sentences that translates our actions

in template literal we can only insert expressions

convert back to es5 using a process called transpiling and also polyfilling
