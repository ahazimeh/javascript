javascript is a high-level object-oriented, multi-paradigm programming language.
multi-paradigm: flexible and versatile, we can use all kinds of different programming styles such as declarative and imparative programming

ES: ECMAScript

name is a reserved word but it is allowed to use, still it could cause some problems

data types: Number, String, Boolean, Undefined, Null, Symbol(es2015-value that is unique and cannot be changed), BigInt(es2020-larger than Number)

in js it is the value that has the type, not the variable

â‹† Asterisk

type of null is an object and this is a bug in js but never corrected for legacy reasons
const for immutable variables

basic operators:
2**3 is 2 to the power 3
+-=*/ x+=
