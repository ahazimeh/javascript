anchor tag is called an inline element because it flows inline with the rest of the text

h2 element for example is called block element
* {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    box-sizing: border-box; // it will include paddings and borders into the width or the height that we specify for an element, ex width 100px with padding 20px will keep width 100px and not 140px
}
