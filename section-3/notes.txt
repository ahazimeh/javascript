"use strict";
use strict should be the first line for it to work
we can activate strict mode only for specific fn or block but no point in doing that

strict mode forbids us to do certain things and create visible errors for us rather than js failing silently
ex: like when updating a variable that isn't defined
another thing that strict mode does is that it introduces a short list of variable names that are reserved for features that might be added to the language a bit later

function logger() {}
logger() // invoking the fn, running the fn, or calling the fn

parameter is the placeholder in the function and the argument is then the actual value that we use to fill in that placeholder that is the parameter

// function declaration
function calcAge1() {

}
// function expression
const calcAge2 = function () {

}

one of the main differences is that you can call function declaration before defining it
